Code for optimal transport computations.

* Optimal transport solved with CPLEX, GPLK or MOSEK
* Fast approximate transport using a mutliscale strategy 
* Sinkhorn optimal transport approach
* Multiscale version of sinkhorn transport
* Rpackage for sinkhorn transport(both multiscale and single scale, depends on gmra r package)
* Rpackage for optimal transport (both multiscale and single scale, requires any of CPLEX, GPLK or MOSEK, depends on gmra r package )
