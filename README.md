![mop-small.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/XyGX46/images/2263246369-mop-small.png)

This code is designed for fast multiscale optimal transport but also permits single scale optimal transport computations and more:

* Optimal transport solved with CPLEX, GPLK or MOSEK
* Fast approximate transport using a mutliscale strategy 
* Sinkhorn optimal transport approach
* Multiscale version of sinkhorn transport
* Rpackage for sinkhorn transport(both multiscale and single scale, depends on gmra r package)
* Rpackage for optimal transport (both multiscale and single scale, requires any of CPLEX, GPLK or MOSEK, depends on gmra r package )
